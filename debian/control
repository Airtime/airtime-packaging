Description: The open radio software for scheduling and remote station management.
 Airtime is an open source application that provides remote automation 
 of a radio station.
 .
 Major features:
 .
 Web-based remote station management.  Authorized personnel can add
 program material, create playlists, and schedule programming all via 
 a web interface.
 .
 Automation.  Airtime has a scheduler function that enables users to
 set shows with playlists for playback at a date and time of their choosing.
 Playlists can be played back multiple times.
 .
 Solid, fast playback.  Airtime uses the open source Liquidsoap 
 multimedia framework for clean, reliable, fast playback. 
 .
 Open, extensible architecture.  Stations are free to extend and alter 
 all parts of the program code.
