_Description: Create apache2 config:
 This setup script can perform apache web-server configuration
 so that you can connect to airtime directly after this installation.

 Production systems should choose "dedicated v-host". This option
 will ask for a Server host-name (FQDN) and will create a minimal apache
 vhost configuration that you can adapt.
 .
 "no, thanks": no problem. You're welcome to set it up however you like.
 Note that the files in /etc/airtime/ may come in handy doing so.
