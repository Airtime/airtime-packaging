.TH LIQUIDSOAP 1 "June 25, 2012" "Liquidsoap 1.0.1"


.SH NAME
liquidsoap \- a multimedia streaming language
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B liquidsoap
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ script | expression ]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Liquidsoap
is a programming language for describing multimedia streaming systems.
It is very flexible, making simple things simple but giving a lot
of control for advanced uses.
.B Liquidsoap
supports audio, video and MIDI streams,
and a wide range of input/output operators
including Icecast and various soundcard APIs.
It can perform a broad range of signal processing,
combine streams in various ways, support custom transitions,
generate sound procedurally...
and all this can be assembled as you wish.
Input files can be accessed remotely, or even be synthesized on the fly
using external scripts such as speech synthesis.
Finally, interaction with a running liquidsoap instance is possible
via telnet or socket.

Liquidsoap scripts passed on the command line will be evaluated:
they shall be used to define the streaming system to be ran.
It is possible to pass multiple scripts; they will all be ran successively,
and definitions from one script can be used in subsequent ones.
A script will be read from standard input if
.B \-
is given as script filename.
Information about scripting liquidsoap is available on our website:
.B http://savonet.sf.net/

If the parameter is not a file it will be treated as an expression which will 
be executed. It is a convenient way to test simple one-line scripts. When 
running only one-liners, the default is to log messages directly on stdout 
rather than to a file.

Print the description of a plugin, eg. a builtin scripting function.
.TP
.BR \-i
