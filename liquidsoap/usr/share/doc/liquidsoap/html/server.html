  <h3>Interaction with the server</h3>
<p>
Liquidsoap starts with one or several scripts as its configuration,
and then streams forever if everything goes well.
Once started, you can still interact with it by means of the <em>server</em>.
The server allows you to run commands. Some are general and always available,
some belong to a specific operator. For example the <code>request.queue()</code> instances register commands to enqueue new requests, the outputs register commands
to start or stop the outputting, display the last ten metadata chunks, etc.
</p>
<p>
The protocol of the server is a simple human-readable one.
Currently it does not have any kind of authentication and permissions.
It is currently available via two media: TCP and Unix sockets.
The TCP socket provides a simple telnet-like interface, available only on
the local host by default.
The Unix socket interface (<em>cf.</em> the <code>server.socket</code> setting)
is through some sort of virtual file.
This is more constraining, which allows one to restrict the use of the socket
to some priviledged users.
</p>
<p>
You can find more details on how to configure the server in the
<a href="help.html#settings">documentation</a> of the settings key <code>server</code>,
in particular <code>server.telnet</code> for the TCP interface and <code>server.socket</code>
for the Unix interface.
Liquidsoap also embeds some <a href="help.html#server">documentation</a>
about the available server commands.
</p>
<p>
Now, we shall simply enable the Telnet interface to the server,
by setting <code>set("server.telnet",true)</code> or simply passing the <code>-t</code> option on
the command-line.
In a <a href="complete_case.html">complete case analysis</a> we set up a <code>request.queue()</code>
instance to play user requests. It had the identifier <code>"queue"</code>.
We are now going to interact via the server to push requests into that queue:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">dbaelde@selassie:~$ telnet localhost 1234
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
queue.push /path/to/some/file.ogg
5
END
request.metadata 5
[...]
END
queue.push http://remote/audio.ogg
6
END
request.trace 6
[...see if the download started/succeeded...]
END
exit
</pre>
<p>
Of course, the server isn't very user-friendly.
But it is easy to write scripts to interact with Liquidsoap in that way,
to implement a website or an IRC interface to your radio.
However, this sort of tool is often bound to a specific usage, so we have
not released any of ours. Feel free to
<a href="mailto:savonet-users@lists.sf.net">ask the community</a>
about code that you could re-use.
